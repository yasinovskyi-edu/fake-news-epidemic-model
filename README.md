# Fake-News Epidemic Model

This repository contains the implementation of a model simulating the spread of misinformation in social networks. The model captures the dynamics of agents (regular users, influencers, bots, and fact-checkers) and their interactions based on geographical and attribute proximity.

## Usage

After building the project, you can run the executable file generated.

- You can configure the number of regular users, influencers, bots, and initial fact-checkers in the model parameters before running the simulation.

- The model's behavior is visualized in a GUI, where nodes represent agents and edges represent connections between them.

This model is an excellent starting point for studying and understanding the dynamics of misinformation spread in social networks. Feel free to explore, tweak parameters, and enhance it to suit your research needs.
